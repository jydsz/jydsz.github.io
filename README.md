# jydsz.github.io
Born from my Apple Shortcut's grade calculator in 2022, this website was my attempt at a cleaner and more accessible version of the application.
Created during summer of 2023 thanks to the help of KhanAcademy's JavaScript and HTML courses.
To access the calculator, type in "jydsz.github.io" as a url.
