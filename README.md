# jydsz.github.io
Website
Born from my Apple Shortcut's grade calculator, this website was my attempt at a cleaner and more accessible version of the application. /n
Created thanks to the help of KhanAcademy's JavaScript and HTML courses.
To access the calculator, type in "jydsz.github.io" as a url.
