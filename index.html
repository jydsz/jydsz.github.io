      <h1> Jydsz's Website </h1>
        <h2>How did I make this?</h2>
<p> I learned the code to make this website using a computer programming course on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css"> Khan Academy</a>. <br>
  The code I used is HTML <em>(HyperText Markup Language)</em> and CSS <em>(Cascading Style Sheets)</em>.</p>
      <h2> Why did I make this website? </h2>
  <p> At the time, I was in quarantine because of the Covid-19 outbreak so I decided to use the time to learn some code. </p>
      
        <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
      <p> I really just made this to see what kind of website I can make using HTML and CSS. </p>
