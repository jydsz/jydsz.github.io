      <h1> Jydsz's Website </h1>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
<p> I made this website using the computer programming course on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"> Khan Academy</a>. <br>
At the time, I was in quarantine because of the Covid-19 outbreak so I decided to use the time to learn some code. </p>
        <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
      <p> I really just made this to see what kind of website I can make using HTML and CSS. </p>
